# Schorschii's Extensions for the Nemo File Manager
This repo bundles useful actions and scripts for the Nemo file manager.

**Attention: Linux Mint 21.3 introduced an official Nemo actions repository. All of my Nemo extensions are transferred into the [cinnamon-spices-actions](https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-spices-actions) repo and will now be maintained there.** Therefore, my Nemo-Extensions repo is now archived.

**Please download the Nemo actions now directly from within the Linux Mint Actions Manager (can be found in the system settings) or from the Cinnamon Spices website. Consider the corresponding README.md and do not forget to install the necessary packages described there.**
